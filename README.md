Assorted items that don't seem quite worthy of their own repos.

* __algorithms__: implementations of various algorithms for reference (also practice for writing unit tests)
* __dotfiles__: my Linux dotfiles (vim configuration, that sort of thing)
* __knr_exs__: my solutions to exercises in Kernighan & Ritchie: The C Programming Language (2nd edition)
* __utils__: various utility scripts (mostly in Bash and Python)
